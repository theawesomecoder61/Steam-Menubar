# Steam Menubar
Steam on Mac OS X has its own taskbar (menubar) icon, just like Windows!

## Why do the Windows gamers get all the fun?
Valve probably never considered about giving the Mac version of Steam a taskbar (or menubar) icon like what they did for the Windows version. This also could be because Windows is a much more popular platform.

## Now Mac gamers no longer have to be jealous.
I actually use the taskbar icon whenever I play a Windows game, and I noticed that the Mac version never had one. So I decided to create one for Mac gamers, like myself.

## Plus, Steam Menubar offers more features.
"What features?", you might ask.
- reorder and choose the menu items you want to see
- add as many seperators as you please
- completely native UI
- small file size
- looks great on Yosemite and El Capitan, regardless of the menubar theme
